Login page can be accessed with `http://localhost:/8080/login`.
If you have authenticator without user verification functionality, fill your username and password, push "login" button,

When a dialog for authentication is opened, acknowledge the authentication with your authenticator.

If you use authenticator with user verification feature, push "login with authenticator" button in login page.
Then the dialog asking authenticator opens, approve the authentication with your authenticator.

If password authentication is permitted for your account, you may login by filling username and password and pushing "login" button.
