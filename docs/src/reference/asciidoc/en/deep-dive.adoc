=== Project Modules

WebAuthn4J consists of the following four modules.

==== Core webauthn4j-core.jar

Provides core features for attestation and assertion verification.

==== Metadata webauthn4j-metadata.jar

Provides additional features regarding FIDO Metadata Service.

==== Test webauthn4j-test.jar

Internal library for WebAuthn4J testing. The included classes don't follow semantic versioning and the design
may be changed even though it is public.

==== Util webauthn4j-util.jar

Contains utility classes used in WebAuthn4J library.

=== Classes

==== Data Transfer Objects

Classes under `com.webauthn4j.data` package are designed as immutable DTO.

==== Converter, Jackson Modules for WebAuthn

Classes under `com.webauthn4j.data` package are designed as being serializable and deserializable.

Some Classes under `converter` package needs custom serializer and deserializer. Jackson's module named
`WebAuthnJSONModule` and `WebAuthnCBORModule` consolidate these custom serializer and deserializer.
WebAuthn4J’s validators register these modules onto Jackson's `ObjectMapper` automatically.

If you want to use WebAuthn4J’s serializer and deserializer outside these WebAuthn4J's validators,
you can register these modules onto Jackson's `ObjectMapper`.

If you want to use your custom serializer and deserializer for WebAuthn4J’s validators for parsing custom extensions,
you can register your custom serializer and deserializer onto `ObjectMapper` and pass it onto WebAuthn4J' validators
via those constructors.

==== TrustAnchorsResolver

`TrustAnchorsResolver` interface is used by `TrustAnchorCertPathTrustworthinessValidator` to explore root certificates
in the verification of the authenticity of the attestation statements.

==== TrustAnchorsProvider

`TrustAnchorsProvider` is an interface that `TrustAnchorsResolverImpl` delegates TrustAnchor load operation to.
KeyStoreFileTrustAnchorsProvider is provided as an implementation for loading TrustAnchor from Java Key Store file.
Spring Security WebAuthn also provides `CertFileResourcesTrustAnchorProvider` to load TrustAnchor from Spring Resource.

==== Exceptions

If some verification fails, WebAuthn4J throws an exception class inheriting `ValidationException`.

=== Logging

WebAuthn4J uses SLF4J as log interface library. You can use any kind of this implementation like Logback as you want.
