== Introduction

=== What is Web Authentication?

Web Authentication is a new, secure web application authentication specification standardized under W3C.
By combining local authentication, public-key authentication, per-origin key management, it provides strong authentication to web sites against authentication process attacks like phishing.
It is implemented in major browsers, offering an excellent choice for users who prioritize security and convenience.

=== What is Passkeys?

Passkeys is a user-friendly branding name for WebAuthn Level 3, designed to improve the usability of the WebAuthn specification.

=== What is WebAuthn4J?

WebAuthn4J is a Java library for server-side verification based on the Web Authentication specification.
It can be used not only for server-side verification of WebAuthn/Passkeys, but also for Apple App Attest and custom applications that use FIDO CTAP2 security keys.
It is a portable library that supports all attestation statement formats defined in the Web Authentication specification while keeping external dependencies to a minimum.

=== Features

==== Supported Attestation Statement Formats

WebAuthn4J supports all attestation statement formats:

- Packed attestation
- FIDO U2F attestation
- Android Key attestation
- Android SafetyNet attestation
- TPM attestation
- Apple Anonymous attestation
- None attestation
- Apple App Attest attestation

==== Conformance

All mandatory test cases and optional Android Key attestation test cases of the https://fidoalliance.org/certification/functional-certification/conformance/[FIDO2 Test Tools provided by FIDO Alliance]
have been passed.

NOTE: Since FIDO2 Test Tools runs tests via the REST API of the FIDO2 Transport Binding Profile, verification is performed against the REST API implementation of the FIDO2 Transport Binding Profile provided by WebAuthn4J Spring Security.

==== Portability

WebAuthn4J only depends on SLF4J and Jackson 3, offering very high portability.
You should be able to integrate it into your Java application with almost no constraints.

=== Requirements

==== Language

- Java 17 or later

=== Environment

- SecureContext (site accessed via HTTPS or localhost. This is a requirement of the WebAuthn specification)
